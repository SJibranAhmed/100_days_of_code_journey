    //Defining syntax error
/*if you try to use a reserved word like if, let, const, function, or return 
 as a variable name, you'll get a syntax error because 
 these words have predefined meanings in JavaScript.*/

//  for example
let function = 'my function'

// this give you syatax error when you hover to it
